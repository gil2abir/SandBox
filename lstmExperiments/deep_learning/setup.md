# MOVING

I'm moving the tutorial to **[vict0rsch.github.io](http://vict0rsch.github.io)** to make it nicer for you guys. This is an ongoing process and your feedbacks are welcome! Basically it will be betetr organized and there will be comments possible. This repo will stay active for the code, issues, pull requests and collaborations.

## Python

I'll assume you work on Python with scientific libraries. If you don't, check out  [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) or this [blog post](https://joernhees.de/blog/2014/02/25/scientific-python-on-mac-os-x-10-9-with-homebrew/) (for Mac users but interesting for everyone).

At least check the requirements if you have a doubt : <http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/install.html#requirements>

## Tutorial's Installs


### Theano
It may seem obvious but do install Theano before Kearas and/or Lasagne.

### CUDA
If you have a Nvidia GPU Theano can use it to do much faster computations; be sure to install all Theano's required [CUDA](http://www.nvidia.fr/object/cuda-parallel-computing-fr.html) dependencies. See also "*What is GPU accelerated computing?*" on Nvidia's [website](http://www.nvidia.com/object/what-is-gpu-computing.html).

### Lasagne
<http://lasagne.readthedocs.org/en/stable/user/installation.html>

### Keras
Keras can use either Theano or Google's Tensorflow as a processing backend. I have not tried Tensorflow so everything I say might or not be portable to the Tensorflow backend. My feeling is that it is.
